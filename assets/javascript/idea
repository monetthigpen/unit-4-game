1.There is a random number dispayed at the begginging of the game
    The random number shown at the start of the game should be between 19 - 120.
    //create a variable that chooses a random number from between 19-120.


2. When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.
          Each crystal should have a random hidden value between 1 - 12.
          Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
          //create a variable for each crystal that will chosse a random number between 1 and 12.
3. When they do click one, update the player's score counter.
        //when the crystal is clicked on, create an if statement that allows the quantity of the crystal variable to added together.
        //create wins variable
        //create loss variable 
        // create a conditional that will add a win if the counter equals random number.
        //create a conditional that will add a lose if counter is more than the random number. 
4. The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
5. The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
6. The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
   //create reload condtion when there is a win or loss. Only reload the random number, crystal's values, and set player's score counter to 0.
7. When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
8. The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
